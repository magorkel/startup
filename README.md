# Ballet On Cobblestone Road

## Elevator Pitch
I own and run my own ballet studio. I teach ages 3 to 14 currently. I love it so much. I love interacting with my students on a daily basis and seeing their progress and sharing their learning moments with them. However, communicating with the parents can be a hug problem for me. I have been unable to find a serice that provides all of the communication in one place. Currently I am using multiple platforms such as text, email, google calendars and google spreadsheets and frankly its a mess. I never know where I've put information or if I've forgotten to update something or if I've sent the right information to the right class's parents. So I have decided to just skip all the fuss and make my own app where I can easily put everything I need and update parents smoothly. Most moms these days are quite attatched to their phones and use them for reminders of their kids activities already, so I thought that would be the best way to communicate.

## Key Features
1. Log in and specific accounts for each parent.
2. On my end a clear list of classes, students and parents contact info.
3. On the parent end they will be able to see the class their student is enrolled in and what time the class is. (This will eventually turn into a calendar)
4. There will be more but for this class, I'm just going to focus on those 3.

## Technology Use:
**HTML** - I will start with 2 HTML pages: one for log in and one for the parents to view the class their child is enrolled in, the 3rd will be the page I see containing all the students info and their classes.

**CSS** - I want this app to look good on all phone and tablet sizes. I don't see this app ever being used for a bigger screen. But I want it to look clean and professional and very easy for moms to navigate and use. 

**JavaScript** - Log in and register buttons work properly and the info page is able to be updated by either parents or me. When changes are made they will call the backend and send changes to the database.

**Web service** - Backend service for:

    * adding a user
    * retrieving user info
    * retrieving lists of classes
    * updating a users info
    
**DB/Login** - Stores users and their info in the database. Cannot log in unless they have already registered. 

**WebSocket** - When a new user registers my list of students is updated. If I make changes to a classes schedule, it updates the parents account. 

**React** - I'm going to use React so that the application can be used on both android and IOS.
