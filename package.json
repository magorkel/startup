  "description": "I own and run my own ballet studio. I teach ages 3 to 14 currently. I love it so much. I love interacting with my students on a daily basis and seeing their progress and sharing their learning moments with them. However, communicating with the parents can be a hug problem for me. I have been unable to find a serice that provides all of the communication in one place. Currently I am using multiple platforms such as text, email, google calendars and google spreadsheets and frankly its a mess. I never know where I've put information or if I've forgotten to update something or if I've sent the right information to the right class's parents. So I have decided to just skip all the fuss and make my own app where I can easily put everything I need and update parents smoothly. Most moms these days are quite attatched to their phones and use them for reminders of their kids activities already, so I thought that would be the best way to communicate.",
