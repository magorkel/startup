## Pushing and pulling between GitHub and VS Code:
- it seems pretty easy, on GitHub, there is a button to commit. It seems to update automatically when I commit from VS Code
- VS Code: go to source control, hover over 3 buttons and hit pull. Same place for commit. don't forget to add comment before you commit

## SSH into my website instance:
- be inside cs260/Keys
- ssh -i balletApp.pem ubuntu@34.230.126.38
- ls -l will list all the things on the website
- type exit to get out
- **Remember to release the elastic IP address and terminate my server at the end of this class**
