Pushing and pulling between GitHub and VS Code:
    it seems pretty easy, on GitHub, there is a button to commit. It seems to update automatically when I commit from VS Code
    VS Code: go to source control, hover over 3 buttons and hit pull. Same place for commit. don't forget to add comment before you commit
